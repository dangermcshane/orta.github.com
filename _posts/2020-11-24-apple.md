During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. They pitched it was a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood. At the time, I was using
Linux for my computer, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get university work done on an
[iBook G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook) and became enamoured by the idea of being a Mac indie dev.

2006 saw the start of the [Delicious Generation](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/) - resurgence of new
developers folks pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and also having an interesting series of ways of
[engaging the community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist). Whilst I wasn't quite focused enough to be able to
contribute to that generation. In 2007, I got a
[student scholarship for WWDC](https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20) and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could pitch my career in. It took till 2011 before I started working on indie Mac
apps, and that didn't last too long due to VISA issues.

I didn't really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community developer community was really
where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.

I never got a job with a focus on the mac again.

iOS grew, it grew and grew till it turned the Apple into a different company.

It's somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple's new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The mac isn't really an OS for me anymore.

I'm not bitter, things have just changed since I made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed, and
so have Apple's.

### The Mac is for iOS Users

I think it's great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now access them as first-class citizens. I think it's
great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more inline with iOS. People with iPhones
are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple's financials (it's a 8% of all
Apple profit, and not really growing.)

### Security

For me native apps have been a

There was a re-design which made
[the OS touch friendly](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/13/app-store-graphic-revives-wild-speculation-about-touchscreen-mac)
and iOS apps can run on the mac as a first class citizen is effectively the.
