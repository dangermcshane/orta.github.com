During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. They pitched it was a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood. At the time, I was using
Linux for my computer, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get university work done on an
[iBook G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook) and became enamoured by the idea of being a Mac indie dev.

2006 saw the start of the [Delicious Generation](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/) - resurgence of new
developers folks pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and also having an interesting series of ways of
[engaging the community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist). Whilst I wasn't quite focused enough to be able to
contribute to that generation. In 2007, I got a
[student scholarship for WWDC](https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20) and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could pitch my career in. It took till 2011 before I started working on indie Mac
apps, and that didn't last too long due to VISA issues.

I didn't really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community developer community was really
where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.

I never got a job with a focus on the mac again.

iOS grew, it grew and grew till it turned the Apple into a different company.

It's somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple's new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The mac isn't really an OS for me anymore.

I'm not bitter, things have just changed since I made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed, and
so have Apple's. That's OK.

### The Mac is for iOS Users

I think it's great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now access them as first-class citizens. I think it's
great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more inline with iOS. People with iPhones
are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple's financials (it's a 8% of all
Apple profit, and not really growing.)

The Mac reaps benefits from the growth of iOS (more engineers, more eyes on the platform, shared tooling). It's the only
platform for making iOS apps on.

The bit that's tricky for me is that I don't use a phone. I just don't find it a useful device for me, when I'm not at a
computer I don't want to be available to others nor to use it as a media consuming device. I have an android device
which I use to occasionally play tower defense games and wish they had an app as good as tweetbot - the only iOS app I
really used.

### App store model

It's unlikely Apple will ever truly force an App Store only system on the Mac. However, that doesn't mean that the
incentives aren't there for apple both financially (because Apple gets a 15-30% cut) or from a security perspective (a
Mac app has a stricter sandbox)

Inside Apple, I bet keeping the Mac a good general purpose computer is a constant uphill battle.

tightening, [Apple Silicon squeezed it](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html) more.

I must stress, for most Mac users these are good things. They don't need a general purpose computer, it seems most
people just want a web browser, a useful file-system and their own edge-case apps.

For me, I don't want to put my time into a platform where the people starting from scratch today have to live in a
smaller, more constrained world.

### Native is just less valuable

The last decade of focus on mobile, has drastically reduced the value of writing a native app for a single platform. The
Mac has kinda been hit the hardest for this in my opinion. It was like a high street of local shops ran by people in the
community, and then all the big shops came in because they just wanted to make sure they represented in the area.

The rise of Electron being the most accessible developer platforms for desktop has meant that all sorts of apps are
available on all platforms. They're performant enough, and far more importantly _they actually exist_. You have to have
a lot of resources to ship a Website, Windows App, Mac App, iOS App and Android app just to somewhat be where your users
are.

Unless your company just a single platform app making it great for one platform, it's just not worth the engineering
investment. Which means all of the apps I use today:

- VS Code
- Slack/Discord/Matrix
- Spotify
- Keybase/Signal

are all cross-platform.

### Apps are going subscription

I've had to switch from some of my native Mac apps in the last few years because they've moved to a subscription. I get
their pressures to do so, and generally blame Apple, but I'm not switching to a subscription for a localt

### An OS is not just an OS anymore

For me native apps have been a

There was a re-design which made
[the OS touch friendly](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/13/app-store-graphic-revives-wild-speculation-about-touchscreen-mac)
and iOS apps can run on the mac as a first class citizen is effectively the.
