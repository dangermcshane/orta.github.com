During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. Somone pitched it to me as a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood.

At the time, I was using Linux for school work, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get
university work done on an [iBook G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook) and over time became enamoured by the idea of
being a Mac indie developer.

2006 saw the start of the [Delicious Generation](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/) - resurgence of new
developers folks pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and also having an interesting series of ways of
[engaging the community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist). Whilst I wasn't quite focused enough to be able to
contribute to that generation. In 2007, I got a
[student scholarship for WWDC](https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20) and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could pitch my career in. It took till 2011 before I started working on indie Mac
apps, and that didn't last too long due to VISA issues.

I didn't really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my programming skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community tools community was
really where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.

I never got a job with a focus on the Mac again.

It's somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple's new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The mac isn't really the right OS for me anymore.

I'm not bitter, things have just changed since I made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed, and
so have Apple's. That's OK.

### The Mac is for iOS Users

I think it's great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now access them as first-class citizens. I think it's
great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more inline with iOS. People with iPhones
are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple's financials (it's a 8% of all
Apple profit, and not really growing.)

The Mac reaps benefits from the growth of iOS (more engineers, more eyes on the platform, shared tooling). It's the only
platform for making iOS apps on and Apple cares about it.

The bit that's tricky for me is that I don't use a phone.

I just don't find it a useful device for me, when I'm not at a computer I don't want to be instantly available to others
nor do I use a phone as a media consuming device. Today, I have an android device which I use to occasionally play tower
defense games, Flappy Royale and wish Android had an app as good as tweetbot - the only iOS app I really used regularly.

### Progressively more restricted computing

It's unlikely Apple will ever truly force an App Store only system on the Mac. However, that doesn't mean that the
incentives aren't there for apple both financially (because Apple gets a 15-30% cut of all transactions) or from a
security perspective (Mac apps have a stricter sandbox and can be trusted more by users)

Inside Apple, I bet keeping the Mac a good general purpose computer is a constant uphill battle.

tightening, [Apple Silicon squeezed it](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html) more.

I must stress, for most Mac users these are good things. They don't need a general purpose computer, it seems most
people just want a web browser, a useful file-system and their own edge-case purpose apps.

The move towards a more app-store focused, sandboxed OS means that whole genres of apps aren't possible anymore. I don't
want to put my time into a platform where the people starting today have to live in a smaller world than I did when I
started.

### Native is less valuable

The last decade of focus on mobile by everyone, has drastically reduced the value of writing a native app for a single
platform. The Mac has kinda been hit the hardest for this in my opinion. The Mac software ecosystem was like a high
street of local shops ran by people in the community, and then all the big shops came in because they just wanted to
make sure they represented in the area. It makes everything quite same-y, but trivialized OS switching costs.

The rise of Electron being the most accessible developer platforms for desktop has meant that all sorts of apps are
available on all platforms. They're performant enough, and far more importantly _they actually exist_. You have to have
a lot of resources to ship a Website, Windows App, Mac App, iOS App and Android app just to somewhat be where your users
are.

Unless your company just a single platform app making it great for one platform, it's just not worth the engineering
investment. Which means all of the apps I use today:

- VS Code
- Slack/Discord/Matrix
- Spotify
- Keybase/Signal

are all cross-platform. A few of the native apps I used to use moved to be subscription services, which drastically
de-values them to me. I'm all for paying money for applications, but subscriptions are a trap.

I do think there's still a space for optimized native single platform software on the desktop (Sketch, Nova and
Screenflow being great examples) but they are progressively becoming more and more niche. Apple knows this, and the Mac
has slowly become a better platform for cheap iOS app ports instead.

### The answer is elementary

This year I started moved to Linux. Notably, [elementary OS](https://elementary.io).

In a way, elementary OS is like using an older build of macOS
([elementary OS 5](https://blog.elementary.io/introducing-elementary-os-5-1-hera/) feels a lot like macOS Snow Leopard,
with [6's feature-set](https://blog.elementary.io/updates-for-july-2020/) echoing macOS Lion). This might sound like a
insult to elementary, but honestly I can't remember what's new in the Mac anymore because I don't really use the new
features. A quick look through [wikipedia shows progressively less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history)
interesting features which aren't copied and pasted from iOS.

There's quite a lot of modern features you could be used to aren't on elementary OS, but the ones that get you
productive are. There's a great terminal, web browser, file manager and your key apps as an engineer. Keyboard shortcuts
work solidly. Almost all of my hardware worked out of the box. Though I am still working on getting my A/V setup 100%.

I've not done a hard switch, my laptop still runs macOS and I'm writing this on that right now - but I'm competent in
using Linux as my daily driver now.

I'm really interested in contributing to the OS, all of the apps seem to be built in a straight-forwards way and I've
found a way to write native GTK applications with TypeScript to scratch my own itches. Hopefully the write-up next year
would include a discussion on how that's gone.
