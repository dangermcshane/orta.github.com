As time progresses, western society is growing further and further apart. The last 5 years have been a cultural
shit-show and it's looking like the 2020s will continue to get worse.

I can sense myself being polarized. Concepts like
[defunding the police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police),
[abolishing prisons](https://www.gq.com/story/what-is-prison-abolition) and
[universal basic income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-income.asp) are somewhat far away from general
mainstream culture. Not to mention feeling like we're at a point where capitalism has really stopped paying its weight.

Here's my general theory on what's happening:

1. ## Technology used to generate more opportunities for everyone

   Globally, we _need_ to add new jobs at the same rate (or more) as the birth rate globally. Older generations of
   technology replaced and augmented muscles, but the stuff we're making today replaces brains. A modern technology
   company can run on significantly less people, and have significantly more impact than one without the a tech focus.

   Not all jobs can be automated, but a lot are, and a lot more will be automated in the future. We built social safety
   nets, but in the UK and US at least, those are frayed and breaking. Today, not having a job isn't really an option
   for a fulfilling life and we're not making enough new jobs.

   Just taking America into account, and _excluding 2020 as an potential abberation_, for the last decade
   [~4 million people are born per year](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm) and there are
   [~2 million new jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-creation-strong-2019-could-162245516.html) being made a
   year.

1. ## Technology concentrates

   The biggest tech companies have the resources to create almost any other sort of business. Is Slack getting popular?
   Microsoft can create a competitor and
   [offer it for free](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/slack-is-taking-microsoft-teams-to-court) to existing
   subscribers. Is your shop selling a product on Amazon? they will create cheaper Amazon basics brand to undercut you
   and then buy your company.

   It should be weird that that Google sells ads, but also offers fibre internet, internet via balloons, wants to
   [run taxes themselves](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-sidewalk-labs-document-reveals-companys-early-plans-for-data/),
   is trying [to undo aging](https://www.calicolabs.com), offers a million free services, operates YouTube, creates the
   software which powers most phones, sells phones, sells computers, sells computers to developers in the cloud, has
   built Ai systems which beat humans at [Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) and
   [Starcraft](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939147/deepmind-google-alphastar-starcraft-2-research-grandmaster-level)
   and the company still has time to achieve
   [breakthroughs in quantum mechanics](https://www.inverse.com/article/59507-full-quantum-supremacy-paper).

   That's a slither of Google. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple all have the same fundamental fluidity at heart too. It's
   easier to build on existing software, it's not like re-tooling a factory.

1. ## Connectivity isn't actually that great

   A phone in your pocket can give you access to all of the words information instantly.

   It also gives you access to all of the disinformation and everyone's opinions. I think all social media companies are
   fundamentally built to connect, but are optimized for engagement. You get the biggest open funnel for new users, and
   then build features to get them keep coming back. Friction gets followers, and having strong opinions on the internet
   is what constantly gets you feedback from others.

1. ## There's too much of everything, so we filter it

   Want to find an article on the internet backup up your feeling? There's almost always something somewhere. That makes
   it easy to feel gratified, but also means that people end up with completely different realities. These realities are
   dangerous because there is often not much shared space for mundane common beliefs. In one reality, world leaders are
   being controlled by a secret cabal with sinister - in another they are inept, and a deep cause for concern for the
   state of politics.
