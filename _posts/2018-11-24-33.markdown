2019, whoah - hi there. So, I'm getting things back on track. I felt like being 32 was a passive year with a generally
downward curve. This year I worked hard to undo that and to try get back to feeling better. I succeeded at that.
Self-care is important in a period of uncertainty.

<p style="text-align:right; margin-top:8em;">This write-up ended up being split apart because of the sheer amount of 
writing I have around my motivations for changing my job. So if you're interested in that, it's lives off in it's 
<a href="/on/leaving/artsy">own space here</a></p>

## On Change

Danger says she's never really had to worry about me before last year. I'm a pretty stoic chap but I guess it leaks when
I'm down for for such a long time. I choose to define myself through what I create digitally, and through the community
work I do, this tends to be focused through the lens of what's useful to my work.

I think of the above as a virtuous cycle of "I need x for work" -> "With a bit more work x can be useful for everyone"
-> "Make x sustainable and discover a larger pattern of y" -> "I need y for work". Work gets better stuff, I solve
problems I enjoy working on.

## Back on the Talks Horse

For the last two years, I'd taken a break from conference speaking. This is something dear to my heart, but tension at
Artsy and a desire to help Danger get accommodated to New York meant it just wasn't a good trade to accept offers to
speak. But this year both of those things have changed.

I was super lucky to basically have an amazing offer thrown in my lap to speak at BrazilJS within my second month. It
was late notice, but I've got pretty good at making a solid talk in about a week. I flew out and ended up getting stuck
in Panama for a day, so I visited the Panama canal and learned about it's history. Hanging out in Brazil was so cool, it
had been about a decade since I lived there. After a few days, it felt like my portuguese was back to mostly
conversational.

The conference BrazilJS was very cool, run by a bunch of punks with a real inclusive vision.

## Open Source

Late last year GitHub announced a project which [sherlocked][sherlocked] a major side-project of mine, Peril. I had been
working on Peril for about 2 years by that point. I reflect it as being a mixed bag:

> Sometimes, you just get sherlocked.
>
> I can be both happy and sad about it.

I got a lot of use from Peril in Artsy and in my own long-tail open source stuff. After that announcement though, I
slowed down my contributions and simply aimed to make Peril stable, solid and tested. Peril had been an escape valve for
me. Prior to interviewing, I explored what leaving Artsy to work on Peril would look like. I think I could have got
enough people to pay that I could have lived in the UK and just done some good work on a small scale for a while.
Obviously, that's now how it turned out, but it was an option.

I didn't replace that Peril-shaped hole with a new big idea. Useful big ideas only come every few years to me, so
instead I contributed by falling back to my design skills instead. I helped out on the design side a bunch for a series
of large OSS projects [React][rn-rd1] [Native][rn-rd2], [Jest][j-rd] and [GraphQL][gql-rd]. They're different scopes,
but still have a pretty big impact for time.

Since joining TypeScript, one of the interesting things I've noticed about working on the team is that I'm finding I
don't quite have the same incentives for doing OSS anymore.

I used to have a feedback cycle where I'd work on things related to Artsy to fix Artsy problems in my spare time. Now
it's just kinda all TypeScript stuff... Which is less healthy. I'll need to think about what this looks like long-term,
but for now it feels reasonable.

## Flappy Royale

This year I shipped a game. Like a reasonable chunk of last generation's programmers I got into programming by
successively building more and more complex games. First, I started with visual [klik & play][knp]-style projects where
you declare how things can interact. Then once the scale of my ideas grew, so did the amount I control I needed. This
led to a programming language [called BYOND][byond]. My years in that community taught me how to program, and how to
positively interact on a forum with internet randos.

While I built enough games in my teens, it became obvious to me that the underlaying tools to create games held more of
an interest to me. Turned out I was more of a toolmaker than a experience generator. I'd use that passion when exploring
new programming eco-systems. For example, when I explored building for the iPhone after years of building for the Mac,
my first steps was to an environment for teaching how to program text adventure games. [See on being 25][25]. When the
programming language Swift came out, I learned the language by porting that engine to the language.

Present day Orta has less time for doing cool but frivolous things, which is a shame sometimes. Nowadays I tend to learn
only for the sake for something very specific. I feel guilty that I'm not applying my skills in a more constructive way.
That's just one of my core drives, and I'm ok with this.

I never got back to building games until this year. Getting started was a series of happy coincidences. I started
playing handball with an iOS games dev ([Zach Gage][zg]) who took his dog to the same dog socialization classes where we
took our dog Murphy ([see 32][32]).

I had mentioned that I was taking a month between jobs, and didn't really want to hang out at my Manhattan home without
a desk. He offered to let me co-work at his place, I took up his offer. We joked around that the world needs more battle
royales, and that flappy bird was a ripe target. I had planned to take the month to recreate my website, but I never
really got around to that. I wrapped up some of the open source design work I had been doing, and started making a few
sketch files of what a multiplayer Flappy Bird would look like.

Lucky for me, [Em Lazer-Walker][elw] was coming to NYC, and planned to take some time to crash at my house. She also was
in-between jobs (also Microsoft) and had extensive experience building games. She loved the idea and we went all in on
it. We started it in mid-May and finished it in mid-July.

If you don't know Flappy Bird or what a Battle Royale is:

- Flappy Bird is an excruciatingly hard game where you take a bird through a series of pipes. The game was super popular
  for about 2 weeks and the author took the game down and said that he didn't want to be causing the world this much
  pain. A bold move when it was making ~30k a day.

- Battle Royale is a genre of shooter-like games, like the movie of the same name, a Battle Royale is a game where there
  are many players and you try eliminate each other till eventually there's only one person or team left. Fortnite is
  the most prominent example of a battle royale.

Flappy Royale was a mix of a really difficult game with the mechanics of seeing 99 other people also trying to get
through the game. You can't eliminate other people, but when the core game is that hard you don't need to - most players
in most games have died within ~2 seconds. Intense right?

There are a few highlights from working on Flappy Royale:

- Getting to work with my wife. Danger typically is more a namesake than a contributor to my work, but for Flappy Royale
  she made a large amount of our art assets. Including some of my favourite characters. High five to [the Happy
  Chappo][hc] who also made some great work!

- Reading all the reviews! These were websites I regularly read. I had to sit down outside to read this Kotaku one. I
  basically told everyone I met that day out in Seattle.

- The panic once we did the math to figure out how much Flappy Royale could cost us if the traffic didn't go down. I
  genuinely froze for a full day, and didn't feel comfortable making any changes. luckily, Em took over and sorted it
  out bringing the costs down from thousands per month to being in the free tier (now that we're on the tail end of
  traffic.)

Eventually it all calmed down. Considering the numbers ( about 20MM games played, 200,000 players in 3 months ) it's a
bit surprising that it didn't come anywhere close to breaking even (skipping our own wages). We didn't really expect it
to make Flappy millions, but the ad revenue got so low, so quickly that it made more sense to remove the more annoying
ads and just say "those aren't worth making our art more commercial".

When we talked to an ad distributor about it, they said that Flappy Royale just wasn't popular enough in a wealthy
audiences (i.e. not big in japan :D). We weren't relying on the money, but it would have been cool to have been worth
signing all those W3 tax forms.

That made coming back to keep doing updates not feel worth it; it's a trade-off on doing TypeScript work at TypeScript
scale vs a fun game in a crowded scene. It's awesome we did it, I'm glad we got it off the ground.

## Moved to Brooklyn

We moved last year, and we moved again this year. This was triggered by two things, our landlord screwed us over and I
joined Microsoft and would work remote.

The first one is a long-one, but TLDR: They never signed our lease because it said we would have a dog. So, we couldn't
have a dog in our apartment even though we specifically mentioned it multiple times during the signing provcess, and
_y'know_ it was in our lease. This was a long-running problem that didn't have an obvious end.

When it became obvious that I was going to work remote. That added a fire to get stuff moving.

Moving house is expensive in New York, so we weren't particularly excited to have to move apartments twice in a year but
I couldn't work full-time from a living room. I needed a space to work, that could either be a co-working space or at
home. I could probably get Microsoft to pay for a co-working space, but I'd had great experiences at home before, and I
can make myself an office I can be proud of.

We moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn, it's still super expensive, but it's very spacious.
