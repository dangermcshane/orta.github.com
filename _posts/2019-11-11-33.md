2019, whoah - hi there. So, I'm getting things back on track. I felt like being 32 was a passive year with a generally
downward curve. This year I worked hard to undo that and to try get back to feeling better.

## Artsy

Well, it's over, after about 8 years of Artsy I handed in my notice. I am so deeply shaped by my experiences there. For
a lot of folks, a job is just a job - but my work at Artsy really was a core part of my identity. I grew alongside
Artsy. I joined as a small-town developer doing remote feature-work on an throwaway app, hired on a recommendation by a
friend.

Now, I'm recognized on the street in large cities, and almost permanently at places where developers hang and I
contribute to code and projects used by millions of programmers, with billions of users down the line. ( My [final blog
post][final-post] on the Artsy blog is one which tries to cover this story through my writing. )

Artsy, the company, owes a good amount of credit there, the culture allowed someone who wanted to go over-and-beyond to
be able to do that in their own direction and on Artsy time.

I left because things had changed enough, and we made a few serious missteps which soured the daily culture. There were
two stand-out points which shook the foundations for the last two years: Artsy's leadership churn and the introduction
of a product org.

### Leadership churn

It's hard to believe that these leadership roles all churned in two years, a lot didn't last a year and most of these
roles don't exist in the same way anymore:

- Cofounder and COO
- CTO
- Legal Counsel
- Head of Design
- Head of Product
- Head of Marketing
- Head of Direct Sales
- Head of Auctions Partnerships

That's almost every business and product lead in Artsy. When the folks deciding the long term vision are in deep
disagreement to the point of leaving, it becomes real hard to get actual work done at the lowest levels of the company.

That could be in the form of job role ambiguity, low morale, or defensiveness within teams which feel potentially
threatened.

There are ways to work around this, effective middle management can provide clarity umbrellas under their org and on
engineering we did a reasonable job there. At least, my one on ones with folks in our org treated most of these
departures as abstractly related to our work. Engineering was lucky there.

Now I'm on the outside I keep tabs on how things are going. It's harder to know, but I trust my inference. Artsy's
replacement for a COO eventually landed [a new CEO instead][new-ceo]. It's likely this should bring about about some
leadership stability in the company, though it will be at the trade-off of a new vision and perspective on what the
company is and should do. Perhaps that's for the best, though reading previous accomplishments in the above article I
can see the company doing well financially but the culture never getting back to its previous heights.

Even knowing all this, I still bought all my stock when I left. I struggle to see Artsy failing at this point.

### Mismanaged Introduction of a Product Org

Artsy got real far with just design and engineering. A typical tech company would have three sets of roles for the
building of user-facing products: Design, Product and Engineering. At a gross simplification: What it look and feel like
(design), what it should do (product) and how should it work (engineering.)

Artsy's older organization structure stems from the perspective of [Robert Lenne][rl], the company's original head of
product and design. He built a culture of product design within the design team, effectively giving the designers in
Artsy the responsibilities of what should be built within the company. This worked very well when the company was
smaller, but the concept was starting to stretch at the seams as design and development doubled in size.

The answer from leadership was that we needed to split those responsibilities and become a more traditional organization
structure. I agreed with this idea, we'd had great experiences in the past where someone had taken up a product
management role within the auctions team.

The first six months of changing the team's structure were pretty disastrous. For the first time, people who I had hired
left the company and the engineering culture took a hit which it never really recovered from. It felt like quite a lot
of people were under a lot of pressure to show results very quickly from these team changes, and this created incentives
for people to take shortcuts and make culture changes hard and fast without necessarily covering all their bases. People
felt a loss of control and we spent a long time trying to find ways to get that feeling back. Eventually, it just kinda
re-appeared with time and work.

Obviously, I don't think there's a world without pressure of some sort but we'd had many successful and considered
re-orgs within the company over the last 8 years. Every product person and most dev leads involved in figuring out what
that transition should look like (myself including) aren't with the company anymore. Looking back, I keep thinking there
a few places where maybe I could have stepped up more, and I regret I didn't.

It's worth stressing that Artsy engineering was in a solid place as I left, this transition happened close to two years
ago and I wouldn't have left if it wasn't going to be OK. The folks there are fun, interesting and making the art world
a better place. If you're considering a job there and somehow found this first, I'd ask people about it but it shouldn't
be a blocker.

#### Things I am proud of

I don't really think I can really write up all the things I'm proud of in the last 8 years at Artsy, too much stuff,
plus a lot if it is covered in this journal.

It sucks leaving because I feel like I knew almost everyone in the US office, it was just about the [dunbar][dun] number
and I felt like I knew how most people ticked. I loved company-wide events and hanging out with all of the other teams
in the company. As Artsy was mission driven, and the mission was easily applied to most of our jobs then a lot of people
were really trying to improve interacting with the art world. I'm proud that I got to hang out with all these folks and
got to know a lot of them really well. It can be easy to just stay in your lane, but I got a lot out of not doing that.

In the last year though, I spent quite a lot of time trying to dig into the history of Artsy to make it easier for
others to get context, one of my favourite examples of this is [the highlights document][highl] I created for Artsy
engineering. This document showcased most of pivotal moments in Artsy engineering, or at least the ones I could remember
(and could poke others into adding) - I'm looking forwards to seeing it in a few years time.

We really did make something special with the iOS team, and we kept our global reputation as we moved from a native
focus to react native one. We were a diverse team with everyone having some polymathic tendencies. That made it a
pleasure to get up to work every day.

This year we saw the first really solid new app features coming into the iOS app which wasn't just a copy of the website
coming from a product team. Which meant a cross discipline team. It was great seeing a lot of architectural decisions
we'd worked on for years start to really show their value in new hands.

## Interviewing

I chatted with Artsy's leadership folks last year about planning on leaving, and I did the same at the start of 2019
too. In part, I was open to changing my mind but things just didn't really fit anymore. One of the main reasons I stayed
through 2018 was to ensure that leaving didn't break things. I'm sure there's the occasional "argh, this is an orta"
thing happening in the dev team, but I think the time I took to try leave elegantly was worth it.

I'd been wondering what to do next for a year or two. Danger and I narrowed my ideas down to three main options:

- I stay full-time employment and we stick in NYC (because I like NYC, and the city is kinda growing on Danger)
- We both take a break from work and take a break year
- We move back to small-town england, and I try take Peril full-time

While you might know the end-result, these were all pretty solid options. However, to get a sense of what full-time
options were I took the time to do some informational interviews at some of the places [I mentioned last year][32-opt].

The first was a very famous private messaging company, and it went bad, the person on the other side of the
informational hadn't taken any time to do research on me. This was disappointing, and not even in a "I'm semi
dev-twitter famous" way. If you don't take the time to prepare for an informational what other parts of the culture are
not going to be thought through?

I did wonder if people just take informationals less seriously than we did at Artsy. Our then CTO was [adamant][db-info]
that we treat informationals critically as they are the first point of contact to a new hire. That night, I tried to
make sure that Artsy continues to do great informationals by [documenting how I prepared for informationals][doc-info]
and calling a best practice.

The other talks went much better. After chatting to the teams, I really just said to myself: What team would I feel the
most proud to be a part of. Like, if I said: "I work at X on Y" - how would that make me feel? This question narrowed my
work choices down to TypeScript vs Peril vs a year off.

While a break would have been nice, the TypeScript team said they really weren't sure if or when they might get
headcount again. I've been in that position, and I could empathize. Given that the timing was lucky (I'd been the first
external hire in years) and it was something I really wanted to do. I said let's give it a shot.

## Why TypeScript?

Well roughly: It's a small team building important infrastructure for a lot of people in the open. This is what I've
done in my spare time for the last 7-8 years, and maybe it can work out for full-time work too.

If you don't know what TypeScript is, I'd recommend reading this non-technical post on [what TypeScript is][what-is-ts]
and why its needed. I created it for Artsy folks when I was telling folks I was leaving.

I have a fundamental love for developer tooling, and arguably a programming language is the purest form of tools. Within
the JavaScript eco-system, TypeScript found its niche by accepting the flaws in JavaScripts. I mean this in the sense
that the siblings of TypeScript have tried to fundamentally change language. TypeScript will give you warnings if it
things you're doing something you shouldn't, but it kinda lets you just get away with whatever you want.

This idea extends really far, to the point of most developers using JavaScript are probably using TypeScript with the
errors turned off and don't know it because their editor is doing it "for free".

Before interviewing I had my reservations about Microsoft, but once I realised it might be a real option I started to do
more research than my simpler idea of _"TypeScript and VS Code are good, so maybe Microsoft has changed?"_. Now I'm
fully indoctrinated, but it doesn't feel like the [evil empire borg][sd-wp] from the slashdot era. Microsoft lost, and
got humbled - that's better for everyone.

## Life at Microsoft

For the last two years, I'd taken a break from conference speaking. This is something dear to my heart, but tension at
Artsy and a desire to help Danger get accommodated to New York meant it just wasn't a good trade to accept offers to
speak. But this year both of those things have changed.

I was super lucky to basically have an amazing offer thrown in my lap to speak at BrazilJS within my second month. It
was late notice, but I've got pretty good at making a solid talk in about a week. I flew out and ended up getting stuck
in Panama for a day, so I visited the Panama canal and learned about it's history. Hanging out in Brazil was so cool, it
had been about a decade since I lived there. After a few days, it felt like my portuguese was back to mostly
conversational.

The conference BrazilJS was very cool, run by a bunch of punks with a real inclusive vision.

## Open Source

Late last year GitHub announced a project which sherlocked a major side-project of mine, Peril. I had been working on
Peril for about 2 years by that point. I reflect it as being a mixed bag:

> Sometimes, you just get sherlocked.
>
> I can be both happy and sad about it.

I got a lot of use from Peril in Artsy and in my own long-tail open source stuff. After that announcement though, I
slowed down my contributions and simply aimed to make Peril stable, solid and tested. Peril had been an escape valve for
me. Prior to interviewing, I explored what leaving Artsy to work on Peril would look like. I think I could have got
enough people to pay that I could have lived in the UK and just done some good work on a small scale for a while.
Obviously, that's now how it turned out, but it was an option.

I didn't replace that Peril-shaped hole with a new big idea. Useful big ideas only come every few years to me, so
instead I contributed by falling back to my design skills instead. I helped out on the design side a bunch for a series
of large OSS projects [React][rn-rd1] [Native][rn-rd2], [Jest][j-rd] and [GraphQL][gql-rd]. They're different scopes,
but still have a pretty big impact for time.

Since joining TypeScript ,ne of the interesting things I've noticed about working on the team is that I'm finding I
don't quite have the same incentives for doing OSS anymore.

I used to have a feedback cycle where I'd work on things related to Artsy to fix Artsy problems in my spare time. Now
it's just kinda all TypeScript stuff... Which is less healthy. I'll need to think about what this looks like long-term,
but for now it feels reasonable.

## Flappy Royale

This year I shipped a game. Like a reasonable chunk of last generation's programmers I got into programming by
successively building more and more complex games. First, I started with visual [klik & play][knp]-style projects where
you declare how things can interact. Then once the scale of my ideas grew, so did the amount I control I needed. This
led to a programming language [called BYOND][byond]. My years in that community taught me how to program, and how to
positively interact on a forum with internet randos.

While I built enough games in my teens, it became obvious to me that the underlaying tools to create games held more of
an interest to me. Turned out I was more of a toolmaker than a experience generator. I'd use that passion when exploring
new programming eco-systems. For example, when I explored building for the iPhone after years of building for the Mac,
my first steps was to an environment for teaching how to program text adventure games. [See on being 25][25]. When the
programming language Swift came out, I learned the language by porting that engine to the language.

Present day Orta has less time for doing cool but frivolous things, which is a shame sometimes. Nowadays I tend to learn
only for the sake for something very specific. I just feel guilty that I'm not applying my skills in a more useful way.

I never got back to building games until this year. Getting started was a series of happy coincidences. I started
playing handball with an iOS games dev ([Zach Gage][zg]) who took his dog to the same dog socialization classes where we
took our dog Murphy ([see 32][32]).

I had mentioned that I was taking a month between jobs, and didn't really want to hang out at my Manhattan home without
a desk. He offered to let me co-work at his place, I took up his offer. We joked around that the world needs more battle
royales, and that flappy bird was a ripe target. I had planned to take the month to recreate my website, but I never
really got around to that. I wrapped up some of the open source design work I had been doing, and started making a few
sketch files of what a multiplayer Flappy Bird would look like.

Lucky for me, [Em Lazer-Walker][elw] was coming to NYC, and planned to take some time to crash at my house. She also was
in-between jobs (also Microsoft) and had extensive experience building games. She loved the idea and we went all in on
it. We started it in mid-May and finished it in mid-July.

If you don't know Flappy Bird or what a Battle Royale is:

- Flappy Bird is an excruciatingly hard game where you take a bird through a series of pipes. The game was super popular
  for about 2 weeks and the author took the game down and said that he didn't want to be causing the world this much
  pain. A bold move when it was making ~30k a day.

- Battle Royale is a genre of shooter-like games, like the movie of the same name, a Battle Royale is a game where there
  are many players and you try eliminate each other till eventually there's only one person or team left. Fortnite is
  the most prominent example of a battle royale.

Flappy Royale was a mix of a really difficult game with the mechanics of seeing 99 other people also trying to get
through the game. You can't eliminate other people, but when the core game is that hard you don't need to - most players
in most games have died within ~2 seconds. Intense right?

There are a few highlights from working on Flappy Royale:

- Getting to work with my wife. Danger typically is more a namesake than a contributor to my work, but for Flappy Royale
  she made a large amount of our art assets. Including some of my favourite characters. High five to [the Happy
  Chappo][hc] who also made some great work!

- Reading all the reviews! These were websites I regularly read. I had to sit down outside to read this Kotaku one. I
  basically told everyone I met that day out in Seattle.

- The panic once we did the math to figure out how much Flappy Royale could cost us if the traffic didn't go down. I
  genuinely froze for a full day, and didn't feel comfortable making any changes. luckily, Em took over and sorted it
  out bringing the costs down from thousands per month to being in the free tier (now that we're on the tail end of
  traffic.)

Eventually it all calmed down. Considering the numbers ( about 20MM games played, 200,000 players in 3 months ) it's a
bit surprising that it didn't come anywhere close to breaking even (skipping our own wages etc). I suppose we didn't
really expect it to make Flappy millions, but the ad revenue got so low that it made more sense to remove the more
annoying ads. When we talked to an ad distributor about it, they said that it just wasn't a high market enough audience.
We weren't relying on it, but it would have been cool to have been worth signing all those W3 tax forms.

## Moved to Brooklyn

We moved last year, and we moved again this year. This was triggered by two things, our landlord screwed us over and I
joined Microsoft and would work remote.

The first one is a long-one, but TLDR: They never signed our lease because it said we would have a dog. So, we couldn't
have a dog in our apartment even though we specifically mentioned it multiple times, and y'know it was in our lease.
This was a long-running thing that didn't have an obvious end.

Moving house is expensive in New York, so we weren't particularly excited to have to move apartments twice in a year but
moving to Microsoft meant working remote full-time. I needed a space to work, that could either be a co-working space or
at home. I'd had great experiences at home before, and moving could mean I can make myself an office I can be proud of.

We moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn, it's still super expensive, but it's very spacious.
