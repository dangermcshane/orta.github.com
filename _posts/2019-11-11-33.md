2019, whoah - hi there.

## Artsy

Well, it's over, after about 8 years of Artsy I handed in my notice. I am so deeply shaped by my experiences there. For
a lot of folks, a job is just a job - but my work at Artsy really was a core part of my identity. I grew alongside
Artsy. I joined as a small-town developer doing remote feature-work on an experimental app, hired on a recommendation by
a friend. Now I'm recognized on the street in large cities, and almost permanently at places where developers hang and I
contribute to code and projects used by millions of programmers.

Artsy the company owes a good amount of credit there, the engineering culture allowed someone who wanted to go
over-and-beyond to be able to do that in their own direction and with on Artsy time.

I left because things had changed enough, and we made a few serious missteps which soured the daily culture. There were
two stand-out points which shook the foundations for the last two years: Artsy's leadership churn and the introduction
of a product org

### Leadership churn

It's hard to believe that these leadership roles all churned in two years, a lot didn't last a year and most of these
roles don't exist anymore:

- Cofounder and COO
- CTO
- Legal Counsel
- Head of Design
- Head of Product
- Head of Marketing
- Head of Direct Sales
- Head of Auctions Partnerships

That's almost every business and product lead in Artsy. When the folks deciding the long term vision are in deep
disagreement to the point of leaving, it becomes real hard to get actual work done at the lowest levels of the company.

That could be in the form of job role ambiguity, low morale, or defensiveness within teams which feel potentially
threatened.

There are ways to work around this, effective middle management can provide clarity umbrellas under their org and on
engineering we did a reasonable job there. At least, my one on ones with folks in our org treated these departures as
abstractly related to our work. Though I think finding out that the CTO, the Head of Product and I gave in notice in the
same week probably really hit the hammer home that something was amiss at the top.

Now I'm on the outside I keep tabs on how things are going. It's harder to know, but I trust my inference. Artsy's
replacement for a COO eventually landed [a new CEO instead][new-ceo]. It's likely this should bring about about some
leadership stability in the company, though it will be at the trade-off of a new vision and perspective on what the
company is and should do. Perhaps that's for the best

Even knowing all this, I still bought all my stock when I left. I struggle to see Artsy failing at this point without
malice which seems very unlikely.

### Mismanaged Introduction of a Product Org

Artsy got real far with just design and engineering. A typical tech company would have three sets of roles for the
building of user-facing products: Design, Product and Engineering. At a gross simplification: What it look and feel like
(design), what it should do (product) and how should it work (engineering.)

Artsy's older organization structure stems from the perspective of [Robert Lenne][rl], the company's original head of
product and design. He built a culture of product design within the design team, effectively giving the designers in
Artsy the responsibilities of what should be built within the company. This worked very well when the company was
smaller, but the concept was starting to stretch at the seams as design and development doubled in size.

The answer from leadership was that we needed to split those responsibilities and become a more traditional organization

### Environmental Changes

#### The People

It sucks leaving because I feel like I knew almost everyone in the US office, it was just about the [dunbar][dun] number

## Flappy Royale

This year I shipped a game. Like a reasonable chunk of last generation's programmers I got into programming by
successively building more and more complex games. First, I started with visual [klik & play][knp]-style projects where
you declare how things can interact. Then once the scale of my ideas grew, so did the amount I control I needed. This
led to a programming language [called BYOND][byond]. My years in that community taught me how to program, and how to
positively interact on a forum with internet randos.

While I built enough games in my teens, it became obvious to me that the underlaying tools to create games held more of
an interest to me. Turned out I was more of a toolmaker than a experience generator. I'd use that passion when exploring
new programming eco-systems. For example, when I explored building for the iPhone after years of building for the Mac,
my first steps was to an environment for teaching how to program text adventure games. [See on being 25][25]. When the
programming language Swift came out, I learned the language by porting that engine to the language.

Present day Orta has less time for doing cool but frivolous things, which is a shame sometimes. Nowadays I tend to learn
only for the sake for something very specific. I just feel guilty that I'm not applying my skills in a more useful way.

I never got back to building games until this year. Getting started was a series of happy coincidences. I started
playing handball with an iOS games dev ([Zach Gage][zg]) who took his dog to the same dog socialization classes where we
took our dog Murphy ([see 32][32]).

I had mentioned that I was taking a month between jobs, and didn't really want to hang out at my Manhattan home without
a desk. He offered to let me co-work at his place, I took up his offer. We joked around that the world needs more battle
royales, and that flappy bird was a ripe target. I had planned to take the month to recreate my website, but I never
really got around to that. I wrapped up some of the open source design work I had been doing, and started making a few
sketch files of what a multiplayer Flappy Bird would look like.

Lucky for me, [Em Lazer-Walker][elw] was coming to NYC, and planned to take some time to crash at my house. She also was
in-between jobs (also Microsoft) and had extensive experience building games. She loved the idea and we went all in on
it. We started it in mid-May and finished it in mid-July.

If you don't know Flappy Bird or what a Battle Royale is:

- Flappy Bird is an excruciatingly hard game where you take a bird through a series of pipes. The game was super popular
  for about 2 weeks and the author took the game down and said that he didn't want to be causing the world this much
  pain. A bold move when it was making ~30k a day.

- Battle Royale is a genre of shooter-like games, like the movie of the same name, a Battle Royale is a game where there
  are many players and you try eliminate each other till eventually there's only one person or team left. Fortnite is
  the most prominent example of a battle royale.

Flappy Royale was a mix of a really difficult game with the mechanics of seeing 99 other people also trying to get
through the game. You can't eliminate other people, but when the core game is that hard you don't need to - most players
in most games have died within ~2 seconds. Intense right?

There are a few highlights from working on Flappy Royale:

- Getting to work with my wife. Danger typically is more a namesake than a contributor to my work, but for Flappy Royale
  she made a large amount of our art assets. Including some of my favourite characters. High five to [the Happy
  Chappo][hc] who also made some great work!

- Reading all the reviews! These were websites I regularly read. I had to sit down outside to read this Kotaku one. I
  basically told everyone I met that day out in Seattle.

- The panic once we did the math to figure out how much Flappy Royale could cost us if the traffic didn't go down. I
  genuinely froze for a full day, and didn't feel comfortable making any changes. luckily, Em took over and sorted it
  out bringing the costs down from thousands per month to being in the free tier (now that we're on the tail end of
  traffic.)
