This one is late. I started writing my first words mid-December. I think it’s best to quote my friend Maddie: “How do
you write anything positive with such a shit-show of a year?” - last year we had Brexit and Trump. This year both are
showing to worsen. It’s hard to not be constantly anxious when the place you grew up is splitting apart, and the place
you moved to has split.

This toxic environment dampens achievements and really brings a much more sombre tone to this year’s write-up. There’s
tonnes of things I’m happy about, and lots of wins but it’s hard to reconcile things I’m proud of with the worsening
state of the UK and the US. I try use twitter to follow people “on both sides”, but that feels like doing so provides a
false equivalence in their stances. A neo-nazi’s opinion should not have the same weight as someone from antifa. There’s
a lot of perspectives without empathy out there, and it makes me deeply sad.

I don’t want to contribute to that atmosphere, so I’ll start of by talking about Danger +my most empathetic story of the
year. We failed as dog fosterers. This year has been dominated with my marriage to Danger, and our move to permanently
live in NYC.

My new VISA allows for Danger to start working, eventually, (she still can’t) in the USA. Until then she’s been getting
through a lot of Netflix: Friends, Cheers, Parks & Recs, American Horror, Dear White People, Blackish, Bojack Horseman.
She wanted to do something a bit more meaningful with her time, so she signed up with [Animal Haven][animal-haven] to
volunteer once a week. By the second week, she was doing 3-4 days a week helping out with dogs. The centre got chaotic
around this time due to the hurricanes happening in Floria and Puerto Rico, which were wrecking havoc with civil
infrastructure. Animal Haven were regularly receiving dogs from those areas, and Danger was on the fostering mailing
lists. We talked to Dave, our housemate, about fostering, and Danger went down at midnight to help prepare.

The next day we were assigned a dog, and Murphy arrived in our cosy NYC apartment. We don’t know much about Murphy’s
background, and we [did a DNA test][dnatest] which only muddied the waters even more. Does this guy look like a
third-chuiwawah, third-rottwieler and a mix of some other stuff?

I dunno. Anyway, after a week of fostering, we took him back to Animal Haven and Danger decided we weren’t going to be
letting him stay there. I supported this call. Within a few days we had a new member of the family. He keeps Danger on
her toes, and now she has someone to watch Netflix with. She’s been doing an amazing job at training him, it’s a really
time-intensive job raising a puppy and luckily for us - she has that time. We’ve got a good network of friends who love
helping out, and our housemate Dave is also a dog person. :+1:

We’ve had Murphy for 3 months now, it’s been great.

I originally opened this post on our our marriage and weddings, as it’s really shaped a lot of the year. I proposed last
year in Central Park, and we handled most of the marriage paper work in 2016. We knew that arranging a wedding-like
event was a lot of time + effort, so we gave ourselves 6 months to run an event and to prepare to move out of
Huddersfield to NYC.

We didn’t want a big expensive wedding. Neither of us are particularly fussy, and we were paying for everything. So we had
full-control, low expectations and could basically do whatever felt right. We wanted to do it local, Danger had been
living in Huddersfield for over a decade, and I had appointed it as my unofficial-hometown (it’s not strictly true,
Halifax was closer to the village where I grew up) - if we were going to move to NYC, we should also be considering it a
farewell part also.

With both of us being non-religious, (we both subscribe to [Optimisitic Nihilism][optimisitic-nihilism] which I think is
classed as apatheism ) we could skip on churches and more formal wedding events. We ended up booking the place where I
used to co-work as a venue: Bate’s Mill. Bate’s Mill is this forward looking industrial factory space, where they host
textile mills, tech co-working spaces, artist studios and thousand people all-night raves. It’s ran by these lovely two
brothers, who’re so fun to talk tech with. I got in touch saying that we wanted to do our wedding there, but that we
planning on handling it all ourselves. This made the event walking distance.

Danger handled most of the event setup. She had to leave her NHS job as a podiatrist to come to NYC, so she opted to
leave a little bit earlier than needed to handle all the last minute preparations. She arranged a bunch of the magic. We
invited people from all over the world.

A nice tie on the bow [check with dm on this phrase] is that we managed to get the same photographer for our wedding as
my sisters both had. He’s been to all sort of biomes with our family: my older sister had a wedding in the sun-drenched
Crete, my younger sister had her wedding in the snow-topped peaks of Canada and me and Danger got married in the rolling
green hills of Yorkshire.

Our wedding party went off without a hitch. It’s cool because this is our second wedding party. We became legally
married back in October 2016, and had tiny civil ceremony in Huddersfield’s town hall and then ordered Indian food back
at my sister’s house.

In keeping with having two wedding parties, we had two honeymoons. The first one was a weekend away in Wales because we
wanted to do the world’s biggest underground trampoline. We actually missed our booking at Bounce Below and went back
the next day. We lucked out - we missed a school holiday, and the day after wasn’t, so we had the entire place to
ourselves for 2 hours.

[Bound below photos?]

In contrast, our other honeymoon was an epic three weeks in Japan. We started out in Tokyo, then moved to Osaka and
Hiroshima and then back to Tokyo. Japan is one of the few places both of us had never visited

I now love ramen.

Japan was a pretty easy decision for a honeymoon, as I had been invited to speak at

Giving us a few more weeks to prepare to make our full-time move to NYC.

I optimistically moved to Huddersfield from my parents’ with with no job, a tiny amount of savings and knowing a few
people back when I was 24. I matured in that town, I owe it a lot. I’m sorry to leave, but I don’t think I could move
back. I’ve turned into a city person, after ~28 years of being country folk.

The underlaying pull for the big city is that there are just so many more people doing the same kind of things as me.
This makes collaboration easier and serendipitous ideas can really flow. Huddersfield was great, but there wasn’t much
of a developer scene. I was close enough to Leeds and Manchester to occasionally participate in theirs, but the
difference in scale to NYC is dramatic.

I’m at my 7th year at Artsy. It’s cool to look back at the brief mention of Artsy in [on being 25][on_being_25_artsy]
and see this section expand out over time. When I first joined the general stressors were “will this work?” - the normal
for an early stage startup, and it did. As the product and company matured it lowered a lot of the risk. Yet this year
has been my most stressful, and looking at from the other side of the project it’s hard to easily pinpoint anything
exact for that.

I’ve never really had problems around deadlines and external expectations at Artsy. Yet, I ended up being roughly 4
months late on what seemed like such a simple 1-2 month project from the beginning. I’m still struggling to quite get
why that happened. After the 1st month of being late I dropped almost everything which I enjoyed doing but wasn’t
directly related to this project’s bottom line. No more: blogging, public speaking, improvements to our tooling and I
even started breaking my personal rule of not doing Artsy product work in my personal time.

The people I work with are understanding, but that doesn’t really help dealing with personal guilt.

It feels like the last few months at Artsy have just been a bunch of sucker punches: I’ve been feeling real down about
being late, our head of design Robert announced he was leaving and then Artsy’s first engineer Craig announced he was
also leaving. Both of these are people who I’ve been working with for the full 7 years, I did a lot more work with
Robert when we were small, and I’ve been doing a lot of work with Craig since we moved to JavaScript.

7 years is a long time to be working at the same place, so I can totally see where they’re coming from. Robert started
his own design agency and Craig just wants to chill out for a few months. But, damn though, I’m gonna miss them.

Artsy continues to be a really cool place to work though. I still think the work is improving the world and worthwhile.

When I think to myself, _“what would I want to do if I left Artsy?”_ - it’s basically exactly what I’m doing now. I’d
want to work on the type of projects I work on at Artsy: sometimes bleeding edge, sometimes perfectly boring. I get to
work with people who are willing to dive deep into all sorts of potential technologies and that’s inspiring. Artsy isn’t
in the "disruption" business (check out [this repo][artsy_meta] for more info) both at business level and within the dev
team, we’re still an outstanding example of community-wide contributors within the iOS and front-end world for our size.

It's likely we'll be expanding the dev team next year and I'm excited at that.

Somehow this year I ended up being [one of the top 20][active] most active OSS contributors to GitHub this year. Part of
this is a life-hack called [Open Source by Default][oss_default]. I’ve been focusing on three things in particular this
year:

**Hardening of CocoaPods**: The last 3 years has been pretty crap in the world of iOS, especially if you care about
mundane topics like dependency management. It's not a sexy problem, but it's the biggest onboarding barrier for a
joining and participating in a community.

What spoiled working on CocoaPods for me was the GitHub Mac team shipped Carthage which stuck around and fragmented the
ecosystem. Then a couple of months later Apple announced their own dependency manger which deprecated both Carthage and
CocoaPods. This is old new now as that all happened two years ago, but the Swift Package Manager doesn't actually
deprecate CocoaPods, because it doesn't handle same problem. It created an entirely new domain for dependency management
(Swift server/CLI apps) and left iOS/macOS apps to CocoaPods. This sucks.

For the last 2 years, Apple has made it not worth putting time into the biggest iOS community project, relied on [by
millions of apps][millions]. They took the energy out of the community, and have one full time employee working on a
replacement. This environment meant almost every active developer on the CocoaPods team left to pursue projects more
worth their time. I did.

Yet, you can't just drop a big project like that, servers need to keep running, PRs need to be merged and the needs of
your dependants aren't static. Luckily, there's fresh blood in the project, Dimitris Koutsogiorgas is basically handling
pushing the project forwards on his own now. There are other people like me who ensure things don't fall over, but
that's it. I don't have the time, energy or inclination to help grow the contributor base any more. So it'll just stay
as is. It's sad.

On the bright side, CocoaPods still exists, and 2 million apps new projects starting using CocoaPods this year. It's not
exactly gathering dust. Still, I feel a loss that CocoaPods could be so much more of a force for lowering the barriers
of entry to OSS and improving the community.

**JS Infrastructure** - Artsy moved more of [our native focus to JavaScript][rn_at_artsy], we needed to ensure that a
lot of the fuzzier edges of JavaScript were hardened. This ranges from feeling confident in the lifetime all of our key
dependencies, to knowing that that Artsy can influence this. The JavaScript culture is pretty different from the native.

A lot of this move has been technical, I've made contributions to many of the key tools that we are using to build our
apps with. For example:

* I am in the GitHub orgs for: [Storybooks][gh_storybooks], [Styled Components][gh_styled] and [Jest Community][gh_jest]
* I am a member of the Jest core team
* I've made PRs to React, React Native, Yarn, VS Code and TypeScript

I feel a lot more comfortable in the JavaScript culture this year. It's only been a year and a half, but I think I
understand where I fit and how the majority of the many node ecosystems work.

**Danger** - I once thought that I would be done with Danger, but Artsy's move to consolidate on JavaScript meant that I
needed to really grok the ecosystem fast. I had been thinking about how to build Danger on a server for a year or two,
but that in order to do it I'd have to make a lot of drastic changes. So I used those as momentum to start Danger JS.

I covered the whys and hows pretty comprehensively in this Artsy Engineering [blog post: Danger][artsy_danger] and in
[On Being 30][on_30]. No need to cover it all in too much depth here.

Once Danger JS was stable, I started work on the server side version of Danger.

The next interesting thing is that in building out the documentation for Danger JS, I got side-tracked into making a
system that allows Danger to run

I've spent so many years studying programming and code architecture. I can jump into most codebases and have a sense
where people have taken shortcuts for time trade-offs, been new to an environment or wrote really well thought-out code.
These are mostly gut feelings from reading and writing so much, you grow a sense of appreciation for the art.

This year, I've tried to improve my appreciation for the structure of storytelling. I strated off reading [The Art of
Dramatic Writing][the_art]

I've taken a considerable amount of time this year studying narrative structures. It's coincided

So we got married last year, which is how I opened

This year was dominated by our actual wedding & Danger's move to NYC.

Was in the UK preps for wedding We had just done our trips to the big bounce, and hung out in wales Then went to italy
and chilled

did honeymoon in japan - awesome lost wallet, sucked
