There is always so much great work by other people to enjoy. I'm expanding the scope of this section a bit more because
it gives it the chance to hit a few more high notes! Given the state of 2020, I think it's nice to read something that's
just whole-heartedly positive.

## Best Of

### Dark

If I can make one recommendation with the hope of it hitting the right person, it is Dark. If you like shows which make
you think and enjoy time travel and/or paradoxical world building then watch Dark. The third and final season came out
in 2020 and it left me with basically no additional questions. Which for a show of its narrative density is practically
unheard of.

The EU made laws around streaming services that they have to have a certain percentage of videos must be created locally
and netflix has released a few bangers, notably House of Paper and Dark.

I honestly don't want to explain anything about Dark, it's great - if you enjoy being challenged by your TV. If you
don't, you'll probably get bored. IMO, give it three episodes to make sure.

### Destiny 2

In a year where being a good citizen was sitting around doing nothing, Destiny became the perfect time sponge. I
literally did everything: played competitive trials, completed every raid, watched tens of hours of lore videos, did the
weekly achievements and maxed out a character. It could offer something back to almost any amount of time.

I re-joined my old clan in Destiny, and got back involved with many old faces and a whole set of new folks. Destiny
offered a constant sense of progress in a world grinding to a stand-still. Was it "progress"? IMO to some extent, yes.
Being human is balancing you needs with others, and Destiny offered a constant social environment to hang out and vent
pressure.

It's a solid game, built on foundations which have been solid for many years. They're doing great work, and the latest
expansion "Beyond Light" is absolutely beautiful. Europa felt really physical and cold. I kept asking Danger to come
over to look at particular mountains or ice caves to try and share just how far computer graphics have gone.

### Hades

For someone who loves the genre Hades lives in, I let Hades slip me by for too long. That said, it was a total pleasure
to come into the game fully polished. Hades takes the repetitive gameplay mechanics of the rogue-like genre and
naturally wraps it in a HBO-worthy narrative.

You play as a young man trying to run away from home, only for that to never truly end up going the way he hopes. I've
ran through the game at least 60 times at this point, and there's still a reasonable incentive for me to keep on going.
During our social December and new years, a run on Hades has been my personal recharge time.

### Anti-Flag

Over the last few years my taste in punk has got rougher and more political, this year I discovered Anti-Flag and I fell
totally in love. For the last 20 years they've made songs which protest the systems of power and not individuals, for
Trump they decided to get personal.

## Games

### Xbox Games Pass

I've played more variety of games than before because of Xbox Games Pass. I get it for free as a Microsoft employee, but
allow me to shill. It turns out I'm very into having a temporary set of hundreds of games. I find the balance between
owning games and treating them as a service is pretty reasonable here because there are so many games shop which
constantly offers deals.

I've had Xbox Games Pass for 2 years, and I still regularly buy games outside of it (every game in this list for example
_isn't_ on Games Pass) but there's definitely enough variety and quality in the sets of games in the pass that I enjoy
loading it up on my windows computer and seeing what's new.

### Hitman

At some point, I really wanted to re-play Tenchu, an old stealth game set in feudal Japan. While there had been a few
re-makes, I was surprised to find that Hitman had a lot of the aspects I enjoyed from Tenchu but had a sense of humour
about itself and had a recent game of the year release.

What a clever game, each level is a massive sandbox of people going about their day and you have to kill a particular
individual. There's usually many different ways to do this (ranging from the brute-force (get near and shoot) to the
meticulous (set up a trophy to explode when someone wins ) ) - Danger says this was her favourite game to watch.

There is something both very cerebral and silly at the same time when a long multi-step plan comes together, but you've
been wearing a flamingo suit the entire time to kill a F1 driver by pushing her brother infront of the moving car. I had
always assumed the game was too serious for me, but I was wrong and I'm looking forwards to Hitman 3 coming out in 2021.

### Paradise Killer

A surprise detective game which gave me some of the vibes from

### Ideas in Code

- [crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)

Crev is a work in progress idea for creating a webs of trust for dependencies. Basically it allows you to say "I've
vetted `x` version 2.1, and `y` version 3.2", then people can say "I trust orta" and so they can trust `x@2.1` and
`y@3.2`. Then I can trust another person, and so on and so on.

An interesting idea, and maybe the Swift ecosystem is small and with few enough dependencies to be able to pull it off.
Hard to see that being feasible in the larger ecosystems like JavaScript/Rust/Go though. Clever idea for sure.
